# nclt
While I was writing the specs of [Ninn](https://github.com/alexeal/side-projects/tree/master/ninn), in **2015**, I imagined a whole **ecosystem** : an editor and a command-line tools to ease the creation of projects through the editor. In university, I learnt bash. So I thought that would be a great start to make a CLI. That's how **nclt** (Ninn Command-Line Tool) came up!
