# Ninn
**Ninn** is a personal project that I started thinking about at the beginning of my studies, in 2012. I wanted to find a personal project that would be important to me and that would allow me to develop my skills. 

Initially, Ninn was intended to be a minimalistic interface, full of keyboard shortcuts. I wanted to take inspiration from my favourite editor Sublime Text. With the evolution of IDEs and the plethora of editors currently on offer, I had to come up with something more innovative. Macaw (a no-code web builder, sort of) and other similar tools gave me the idea of offering more than just shortcuts: drag'n'drop snippets. Bye bye the usual copy and paste or keyboard shortcut. Drag'n'drop would make it easier to code on a tablet too!
